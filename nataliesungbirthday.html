        <img src="birthdaygirlpics/happybirthdayheart2.png" alt="Happy Birthday Sign" id="HappyBirthdaySign">

        <p class="Message">HAPPY BIRTHDAY BUBBASSS!!!! I love you soo soo soo much you don't even understand. I can't believe we're dating while I celebrate your birthday with you. I literally remember watching you from afar at Winnetka last year for your birthday and how badly I wished I could have been apart of that crowd that was celebrating with you. It's crazy that that day was another one of the days where I fell in love with you. I just loved seeing your energy and how much fun you were having with all your friends. To this day, I love that so much about you.</p>

        <img src="birthdaygirlpics/beautifulnatalie47.jpg" alt="Pretty Girl in Korea" id="BirthdayGirl">

        <p class="Message">Our relationship has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. Dating you has given me purpose, motivation to be a better man, and an overall joy and appreciation for life that I never felt before. It really feels like you gave my life color. I love you so much and I could never express in words just how much you mean to me. It's gotten to the point where you flood my thoughts everyday. I'm always thinking of you and your pretty smile, your cute laugh, and all your little farts. I truly wish you have the best birthday of your life. Again, I love you so much, you're the best girlfriend I could have ever asked for. Happy Birthdayy!!!</p>

        <p class="Message">Now, I don't know if you were already suspecting this because of all the hints I was dropping from my class and my assignments, but I made a little gallery for you going over some of our fun and memorable moments we've had together. This gallery covers from July to May, but it is honestly missing a lot of pictures and details in the captions, so this is something we can continue to work on together as time goes on! Anyways, I hope you enjoy this little gallery I made, I LOVE YOUUU!</p>

Calic my first time was also soo good, and you looked sooo good. It was such a good time and you were really slowly enchanting me more with your spells.</p>
